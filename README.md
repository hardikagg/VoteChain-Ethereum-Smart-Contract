# VoteChain

VoteChain is a Decentralized Application which used Ethererm Smart Contracts for voting.<br><br>

It is a B.Tech final year project.<br>
For now, it runs only on local Truffle Develop blockchain. <br>
I am working on transferring it to 'Ganache' then to a test network probably Rinkeby Test Network.<br><br>

Web3 instance is used and with its transformation to Ganache local network, Metamask will be considered.<br><br>

How it works?<br><br>

You need to have Node and NPM as basics.<br><br>

You must run these commands for truffle.js<br><br>

> npm install -g truffle (You may need to install it by running the terminal as administrator)<br>
> git clone https://github.com/hardikagg/VoteChain-Ethereum-Smart-Contract.git<br>
> cd VoteChain-Ethereum-Smart-Contract<br>
> npm install<br><br>

Then, open up a new terminal tab:<br><br>

> truffle develop<br>
> compile<br>
> migrate<br>

Go back to your previous tab:<br><br>

> npm run dev<br><br>

Don't close any of the terminal.
